Setup Instructions

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/VishnuPriya072/student-teacher-appointment-booking.git

2. Install XAMPP (or MAMP for macOS users)
Make sure to have a web server like XAMPP (for Windows/Linux) or MAMP (for macOS) installed.

3. Database Setup

Open phpMyAdmin (usually accessible at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).
Create a new database called appointment_system.
Run the following SQL queries in phpMyAdmin or MySQL CLI to create the necessary tables:sql

CREATE DATABASE appointment_system;

USE appointment_system;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE appointments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    teacher_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    appointment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    appointment_time TIME NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE teachers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    teacher_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Sample data for teachers
INSERT INTO teachers (teacher_name) 
VALUES ('Mr. John'), ('Ms. Emily'), ('Dr. Smith'), ('Prof. Andrew');

4. Configure the Project

Place the project folder inside your web server directory (e.g., htdocs in XAMPP or Sites in MAMP).
Edit the database connection in login.php, register.php, and appointment.php as necessary. Example:php

$servername = "localhost";

$username = "root";
// Default username for XAMPP/MAMP

$password = ""; 
// Default password for XAMPP/MAMP (often blank)

$dbname = "appointment_system";

5. Start the Server

Open XAMPP/MAMP and start Apache and MySQL servers.
Access the project via http://localhost/student-teacher-appointment/register.php to begin registration.
